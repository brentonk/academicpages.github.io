**Abstract.**
There are many forms of coercion—including supporting rebel groups, sanctions, and cyberattacks—but formal models commonly characterize interstate bargaining as dichotomous, ending in either war or peace. How does the availability of intermediate policy options affect the incidence of war and peace? We present a game-free analysis of crisis bargaining models with flexible policy options that challenges conventional results about the relationship between private information and negotiation outcomes. Unlike in traditional crisis bargaining models, we find that greater private war payoffs may be associated with a lower probability of war or worse settlement values. Our results are not specific to any particular game form, but instead emerge regardless of the precise negotiating protocol. By combining the substantive richness of flexible policy responses with the generality of a mechanism design analysis, we derive robust explanations of how private information influences international conflict.
